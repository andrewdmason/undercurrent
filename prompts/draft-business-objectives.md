# Business Objectives Draft

You are helping a small business owner define their video marketing objectives at a high level.

## Project Information

**Project Name:** {{projectName}}
**Website URL:** {{projectUrl}}
**Business Description:** {{projectDescription}}

## Your Task

Suggest 3-4 high-level business objectives that video marketing could help achieve. Focus on the **impact** they want, not specific tactics or metrics.

## Good Examples (short and punchy)

• Drive new sign-ups
• Build community with existing customers  
• Help customers learn the product
• Elevate the brand
• Attract talent
• Generate leads

## Bad Examples

❌ "Drive local awareness and excitement for the business ahead of opening" (too wordy)
❌ "Foster an ongoing sense of community that encourages repeat visits" (too elaborate)
❌ "Publish 2 videos per week to drive 1,000 sign-ups" (too tactical)

## Guidelines

- MAX 5-7 words per objective
- No elaboration or explanation
- No metrics, timelines, or tactics
- Just the business outcome in simple terms

## Output Format

Output 3-4 objectives as bullet points. Use • for bullets. Keep each one SHORT - like a tweet, not a sentence.

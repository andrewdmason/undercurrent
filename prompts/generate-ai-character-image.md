# Generate AI Character Image

Generate a medium close-up portrait image of a character, styled like a YouTuber talking directly to camera.

## CRITICAL Composition Requirements

This MUST look like a frame from a YouTube video where someone is talking to their audience:

- **Framing:** Medium close-up shot - head and upper chest/shoulders visible, cropped at roughly mid-chest level
- **Pose:** Character facing the camera DIRECTLY, looking straight at the viewer. Simple, neutral pose with hands down and out of frame. NOT holding anything. NOT doing any action. NOT gesturing.
- **Expression:** Friendly, approachable, mid-sentence expression—like they're explaining something to the viewer
- **Body position:** Shoulders square to camera or turned very slightly. Arms relaxed at sides (out of frame)
- **Background:** Simple, slightly blurred background suggesting a home office, studio, or casual indoor setting. Nothing distracting.
- **Aspect Ratio:** Square (1:1) for avatar use

## What NOT to include

- NO hands visible in the frame
- NO props or objects being held
- NO action poses or dynamic gestures
- NO full body shots
- NO side profiles - must be facing camera
- NO busy or distracting backgrounds

# Business Description Draft

You are helping a small business owner create a compelling description of their business for a video marketing platform. This description will be used by AI to generate relevant video ideas.

## Project Information

**Project Name:** {{projectName}}
**Website URL:** {{projectUrl}}
{{websiteContent}}

## Your Task

Write a concise but comprehensive business description (2-3 paragraphs) that captures:

1. **What the business does** - The core product/service offering
2. **Who they serve** - Target customers/audience
3. **What makes them unique** - Key differentiators, value proposition
4. **Tone/personality** - The brand voice (professional, friendly, edgy, etc.)

## Guidelines

- Write in third person (e.g., "Acme Inc. is..." not "We are...")
- Be specific and concrete, not generic
- **Use the website content above as your primary source** - it contains the actual information about this business
- If no website content is available, make reasonable assumptions based on the business name
- Keep it focused - this will be used for generating video content ideas
- Aim for ~100-200 words

## Output Format

Output ONLY the business description text. Do not include any JSON formatting, headers, or explanation. Just write the description as plain text that can be directly used.

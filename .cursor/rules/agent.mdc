## Domain Concepts

### Descript Underlord

Underlord is Descript's AI editing assistant - think of it as the video editing equivalent of Cursor. It's a "vibe-editing" chatbot where you describe what you want done and it executes like an assistant editor would. Unlike simple command-based tools, Underlord can accept long, detailed prompts including full scripts, multi-step editing instructions, and creative direction. When Undercurrent generates an "Underlord prompt," users copy/paste it into Descript to automate their video production workflow.

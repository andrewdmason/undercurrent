Shelf of Shame: a still-in-shrink Kickstarter co-op like Oathsworn and a three-year-unopened Terraforming Mars box. Strategy Labs: multi-rematch nights for games like Root and Gaia Project, aimed at Berkeley/Oakland euro/strategy gamers. Family-Friendly Blocks: games like Cascadia, Sushi Go, and Karuba for kids + parents in earlier time slots. Assume they’re not launching big formal tournaments or late-night drunk party blocks at first, but we don’t dwell on that; just imply it by focusing on curated, welcoming events. Member feedback: mention hearing from grad students who only have 2 hours on a weeknight, parents who need strict end times, and introverts who hate being dropped into mystery tables. CTA phrased conversational but clear: “If you want a say in what we run week one, hit the link in the description and get on the founding member list.” Call out local playstyles lightly: Berkeley euro/strategy nerds, co-op lovers, families, and board-game-curious folks who feel intimidated. Overall tone: warm, a little self-deprecating, anti-generic-‘board-game-night’, focused on intentional structure of event calendar. Keep it tight enough for 45–60s but with beats that Andrew can compress or expand when recording.","hasContextSummary":true,"contextLength":1475},"timestamp":1765658354648,"sessionId":"debug-session","hypothesisId":"A,B"}
